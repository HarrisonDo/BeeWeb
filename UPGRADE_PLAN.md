# BeeWeb Framework Upgrade Plan

## Recommendation

Use `Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript` for the main BeeWeb frontend.

The current app is a WebSocket chat workbench. The hard parts are session state, streamed message routing, Markdown rendering, foldable tool/think blocks, and future protocol growth. Vue 3 gives us a clean component model and composables without forcing a full application framework.

## Why Vue 3

- Single File Components keep template, logic, and local styles together.
- Composition API fits reusable logic such as WebSocket handling, sessions, Markdown, and protocol normalization.
- Vite gives fast local development and a small build setup.
- The ecosystem is common enough for future Codex/human maintenance.
- The previous native `demo.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` are archived under `old/`.

## Compared Options

| Option | Fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vue 3 + Vite | Best default | Balanced maintainability, ecosystem, and low migration risk. |
| Svelte 5 + Vite | Good | Very concise, but runes add some learning cost. |
| SolidJS + Vite | Good for performance | Fine-grained updates suit streaming, but ecosystem familiarity is lower. |
| React + Vite | Acceptable | Large ecosystem, but this project does not need a heavier React app stack yet. |

## Suggested Stack

- `vite`
- `vue`
- `typescript`
- `markdown-it` or `marked`
- `dompurify`
- Optional later: `pinia`
- Optional later: virtual list package for very long chat histories

## Target Structure

```text
src/
  components/
    ChatMessage.vue
    FoldBlock.vue
    SessionList.vue
    Composer.vue
    ConnectionPanel.vue
  composables/
    useWebSocketAgent.ts
    useSessions.ts
    useMarkdown.ts
  protocol/
    types.ts
    normalizers.ts
  styles/
    base.css
```

## Migration Plan

1. Archive the native frontend under `old/`.
2. Use the Vite + Vue + TypeScript app as the root project.
3. Move protocol types and normalizers first.
4. Move session and WebSocket logic into composables.
5. Build `ChatMessage` and `FoldBlock` from current rendering behavior.
6. Replace the custom Markdown renderer with a library plus sanitization.
7. Validate against current backend events:
   - `text`
   - `history_request`
   - `think`
   - `tool_calls`
   - `tool_result`
   - `close`
   - `end`
8. Validate feature parity against the archived native frontend before removing old references.

## Upgrade Start Log

- 2026-05-13: Started the parallel Vue/Vite/TypeScript upgrade in `vue-upgrade/`.
- Migrated the first protocol surface into TypeScript: event types, payload normalization, `messageId` resolution, and tool-call/tool-result formatting.
- Added first-pass Vue components and composables for sessions, WebSocket connection, chat messages, fold blocks, composer, and connection controls.
- Kept `demo.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` as the stable native frontend baseline.
- 2026-05-13: Promoted the Vue/Vite app to the repository root and archived the native frontend in `old/`.

## Current Priority Before Migration

- Fix native frontend scrolling during streamed output.
- Improve keyboard behavior.
- Keep protocol docs accurate for backend development.
